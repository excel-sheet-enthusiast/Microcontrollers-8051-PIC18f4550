All practical codes associated with 'Microcontroller' course under SPPU 2019 Pattern. 
List of Laboratory Experiments 
Group A (All compulsory)
1. Verify the sampling theorem and aliasing effects with various sampling frequencies. Also 
implement the sampling theorem using VLAB.
2. Find the z-transform of a given difference equation, compute its pole zero plot and comment on its 
stability. 
3. Compute DFT and IDFT {e.g. x(n) = {1,2,3,4} using N=4 and N= 8} and observe the effect on the 
resolution on magnitude plot.
4. Find N-point circular convolution using formula and verify its results. Implement linear filtering 
using circular convolution.
5 a) Implement IIR structures using Direct form I/ II/ Cascade form.
b) Implement FIR structures using Direct Form/Cascade/Linear phase structures.
6. Study the windowing effect (time and frequency) for Rectangular, Hamming, Hanning, 
Blackmann and Kaiser windows. 
Group B (Any Two)
7. Design a Butterworth filter using Bilinear Transformation, for the following conditions:
0.8≤|〖H(e〗^jω)| ≤1 0≤ ≤0.2π
|〖H(e〗^jω)≤|≤0.2 0.6≤ ≤π
OR
Design a Second order band pass Digital Butterworth filter with passband of 200 Hz to 300 Hz 
and sampling frequency of 2000Hz using Bilinear Transformation.
OR
Evaluate the order and the poles of a Butterworth filter which has a 3dB bandwidth of 1000Hz 
and a attenuation of 20dB at 2000 Hz. Determine the system function H(z) by Bilinear 
Transformation using T=1/10000
8. Design the symmetric FIR low pass filter for which desired frequency response is expressed as 
Hd (ω)={(e^(-jωτ for|ω|≤ ωc ) and 0 elsewhere
The length of the filter should be M = 7 and ωc=1 radians/sample. 
Make use of the Rectangular/ Hamming/ Hanning/Blackman/ Kaiser window.
9. Verify the Sampling Theorem in frequency domain using FFT for undersampled, Nyquist and 
oversampled signals.
10. Compute the DFT by writing a function for the N > 32 sequence. Calculate the computational 
complexity. Compare the time required by DFT & FFT functions.
Group C (Any Two)
11. Implement the Block Convolution algorithms: a) Overlap-add b) Overlap-save
12. Find the pitch frequency of given speech signal using the autocorrelation method
13. Implement the following ECG Signal Processing operations:
a) Suppression of motion artifacts in ECG using N point moving average filters. 
b) Peak detection of ECG signal by using Band-limiting digital filters 
14. Image feature extraction using 2D convolution
